Implementation notes and TODOs:

- This backend intentionally keeps encryption logic on the client. Server only stores Nostr events (raw).
- The chat endpoint is a naive example. For production use, build robust query patterns (e.g., index tags properly).
- Consider migrating to Postgres (for full text search) or Turso/PlanetScale as discussed.
- Add auth for admin/group endpoints; implement rate-limits and moderation tools.
